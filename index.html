    <h1>EclecticMatt's Isolation Bots</h1>

    <p>This is a summary of my Isolation Bots for remote gameplay! These are Bots which allow players to play party and board games via Discord. Find out more about the Bots by clicking the large headings below!</p>

    <h2>Issues and Feedback</h2>
    <p>If you have any issues or feedback to provide, please feel free to <a href='mailto:eclecticappdevelopment@gmail.com?subject=Bot_Issues'>send me an email with more details</a> and I will try to get back to you as soon as possible! Thank you!</p>

    <p>The most common issue reported is "not receiving direct messages from the Bot" which is something I cannot fix on my end. This can be fixed by either changing your privacy settings to allow Direct Messages from the Bot, or by affected users sending a message to the Bot (click it's name in the channel and send any message to it) which will allow you to receive the Direct Messages (e.g. Spymaster Grid for the Codenames Bot). See this <a href='https://stackoverflow.com/a/49583416' target='blank'>Stack Overflow answer</a> for more information.</p>

    <div id="Instructions" class="w3-container w3-hide w3-indigo w3-animate-zoom">

      <p><b>Getting started: </b>You will need to invite your chosen Bot to a Discord server where you have admin rights. Use the invitation link for the Bot below, and then choose which server to add it into. You will need to give them admin rights, so they can read/send messages in the channel and send direct messages to users in that channel.</p>

      <p><b>Using the Bots: </b>Each Bot has its own commands, which will be listed in the information for your selected Bot below. The Bot should send a welcome message in the channel when it gets added, so you know the "help" command to learn how to use them.</p>

      <p><b>Installing Bots yourself: </b>All of the source code for each Bot is available on Github. Use the README in the main folder for installation instructions, including any dependencies which will need to be installed at the same time (all the Bots run on Node.JS so some familiarity with Node and NPM would be helpful).</p>

      <p><b>Bot hosting: </b>The Bots are hosted on Heroku, which allows them to run permanently for gamers across the world. However, this may have to change once more Bots are added, as my free "dynos" only allow a certain amount of free hours. If you would like to contribute then please send me a coffee or subscribe to my Patreon to help fund development of these Bots!</p>
